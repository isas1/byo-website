    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
    <p>As a qualified Computer Science teacher, I have taught across London in both all-boys and all-girls schools
      (pupils aged 11 - 18) whilst spending some time in mixed secondary and primary schools. This has allowed me to
      teach and relate to a wide range of students, some of whom made independent requests to the headmaster that I
      stay on! Currently, I have just taken a post in the TES school of the year, with the intention of helping
      students develop academically and personally as they move into adulthood.</p>

    <p>Given my background in Computing, Web Development and Programming, alongside 8 years working within the Systems
      Support industry, I have developed the knowledge and resources to cover teaching at all ages: from Primary School
      to A-Level, and beyond.</p>

    <p>Everyone learns in a slightly different way and at different speeds so my lessons are diverse, structured around
      and tailored to students' needs. Some lessons are highly structured, where a new concept is taught or practice is
      required; others are less structured to enable development of independent skills, such as problem-solving,
      resilience to adversity or searching for the correct code modules to incorporate into a program. All of these are
      crucial components in enabling students to become good programmers and problem solvers.</p>
